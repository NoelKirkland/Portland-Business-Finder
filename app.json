    "description": "Portland Business Finder is a cross-platform mobile application written in JavaScript using React-Native. With this application you can take full advantage of the Yelp API to search businesses in your area. Your search results are separated into three price categories: \"$\" for the most budget friendly businesses, \"$$\" for more average prices, and \"$$$\" for businesses on the pricier end. Each listing will display the name of the business, a thumbnail image, star rating, and number of reviews. Tap on a listing's thumbnail image to see more details about that business. On a particular business's details screen you will find things like: additional images, their listed address, and whether they are open or not.",
